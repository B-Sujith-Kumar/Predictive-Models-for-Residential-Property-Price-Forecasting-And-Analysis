# Predictive-Models-for-Residential-Property-Price-Forecasting-And-Analysis

The project "Unveiling the Future: Predictive Models for Residential Property Price Forecasting and Analysis" aims to develop predictive models for residential property price forecasting and analysis using a dataset obtained through web scraping from the ‘Makaan’ website. The rapid growth of the real estate market and the need for accurate property price predictions have motivated this research.

The project involves web scraping techniques to gather data from the ‘Makaan’ website, which is a prominent online platform for real estate listings. The collected dataset comprises various attributes related to residential properties, including location, area, number of bedrooms, amenities, and the corresponding price.

To analyse and forecast property prices, the project utilizes machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques. The dataset is pre-processed to handle missing values, outliers. Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights and identify patterns in the data. Several predictive models will be developed, including regression models such as linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. 

The project aims to provide valuable insights into residential property price trends and assist stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and real estate agents, in making informed decisions. Accurate price forecasting can aid buyers in determining fair market values and sellers in setting competitive prices. Moreover, real estate investors can leverage the predictive models to identify potential investment opportunities.
